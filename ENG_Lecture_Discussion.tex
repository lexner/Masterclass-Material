         \item [\ding{73}] Origin of mass: Higgs mechanism
            \item [\ding{73}] Why and how do quarks group into hadrons? There are hadrons with more than three quarks!
            \item [\ding{73}] Why is there more particle matter than antiparticles/antimatter in the universe?
            \item [\ding{73}] Dark matter, dark energy: Are there still \emph{new}, undiscovered particles, forces and physics?

        \item \textbf{You} have discovered five new particles today!
        \item \textbf{You} learnt today how particle physicists search for new particles.
        \item \textbf{You} got excited about studying physics today :p
