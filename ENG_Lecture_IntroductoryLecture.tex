 \\
Remember the properties of the particles you know: \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> mass \hfill $m$ \hspace{6cm}\,
    \item<2-> electric charge \hfill $q$ \hspace{6cm}\,
    \item<2-> energy \hfill $E$ \hspace{6cm}\,
    \item<2-> momentum \hfill $\vec{p} $ \hspace{6cm}\,
    \item<2-> velocity \hfill $\vec{v}$ \hspace{6cm}\,
 
 \\
    \item<3->[\ding{220}] How can we measure these properties with the LHCb detector?
