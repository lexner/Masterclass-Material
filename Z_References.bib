abstract = {This report presents a summary on radiative decays of the ψ states. Most of the experimental information has been obtained by the experiments DM2, Mark III and Crystal Ball, operating at the storage rings DCI and SPEAR. Radiative decays from the ψ′ yields an abundance of information on the C-parity even states within the charmonium system. Nearly all experimental data on χ and ηc mesons compare favorably with theoretical predictions. Overall, an impressive agreement emerges between charmonium spectroscopy and theoretical models. Radiative transitions from J/ψ to light mesons have helped to better understand the low lying nonets. Two unexpected resonances, the ι(1460) and Θ(1700), have large production rates and exhibit unusual decay properties. The Θ is almost certainly a non-qq state and qualifies as a gluonic meson candidate. The ι is more controversial. A classification will have to depend on a detailed understanding of the excited pseudoscalar nonet. Finally, evidence for the ξ(2200) will be reported and its interpretation will be reviewed.}

abstract = {We perform a search for near-threshold Ξb 0 resonances decaying to Ξb −π+ in a sample of proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb−1 collected by the LHCb experiment. We observe one resonant state, with the following properties: (Formula presented.). This confirms the previous observation by the CMS collaboration. The state is consistent with the JP = 3/2+ Ξb ∗0 resonance expected in the quark model. This is the most precise determination of the mass and the first measurement of the natural width of this state. We have also measured the ratio (Formula presented.)}
